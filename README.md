## INTRODUCTION.

The Bookshelf app is designed to help users manage their book collection, allowing them to sign in, explore the NY Times best sellers, leave book reviews, and easily purchase books from Amazon. It provides a convenient platform for book enthusiasts to discover new titles, share their thoughts, and make purchases effortlessly.

Key Features of the Bookshelf App:

   * User Authentication: Users can create accounts and sign in to access personalized features, such as leaving book reviews and saving their favorite books.

   * NY Times Best Sellers: The app displays a curated list of NY Times best-selling books, allowing users to discover popular and highly acclaimed titles.

   * Book Reviews: Users can leave their reviews and ratings for books they have read. They can share their thoughts, recommendations, and insights to help others make informed reading choices.

   * Amazon Integration: Each book listing includes a link to purchase the book on Amazon. By clicking on the link, users are redirected to the corresponding book's page on Amazon, making it convenient for them to make purchases.

## Setup and Installation
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
      `git clone git@github.com:mich785/Phase-3-Project.git`
   - Install the required dependencies using 
   
      ``npm install``
      ``bundle install``
   - Run the application using 
   
       ``bundle exec rake server``

## Approach
   The application was built using the React.js library, which allowed for efficient component-based development and state management. The back-end makes use of an online public server to fetch books data and display it to the user. pp serves as a comprehensive tool for book lovers, offering a seamless experience for exploring, reviewing, and purchasing books. Whether users are seeking recommendations or want to share their own insights, the app provides a user-friendly platform to engage with the literary world.

## Status
   The application is fully functional and ready for use. However, further improvements and features could be added in the future, books saving and sharing, and social media integration.
